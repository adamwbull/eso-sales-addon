## Client Info

This `/Client` folder is where the compiled .exe and associated files would be stored.

The `ESOSalesLauncher.exe` is the launcher application. It bundles ESOSales, TTC (if it is detected in the Addons folder), and the main ESO launcher together to start ESOSales and TTC monitor programs along with ESO all at once along with a nice interface for settings and auto-launch.

You can see the main README.md for the repo for more information on how to build the launcher.
